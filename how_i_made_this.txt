1- created a virtual python environment for sanskrit STT named "sktSTTenv".

2- downloaded .whl file of pocketsphinx from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

3- installed 'pocketsphinx-0.1.15-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl' file in sktSTTenv.

4- wrote plugin.py

5- downloaded SRILM.

6- installed cygwin.

7- installed SRILM in cygwin. Installation help taken from "https://hovinh.github.io/blog/2015-12-22-install-srilm-windows/". Author of the guide has mistakenly written 'cygwin' as 'cyqwin' many times. Also replace "export PATH=$PATH:$pwd:$SRILM/bin/cygwin" in the guide with "export PATH=$PATH:$SRILM/bin:$SRILM/bin/cygwin64".

8- downloaded sanskrit corpus. Made a 'cleaner.py' script to clean the text.

9- created language model using SRILM. Guide - https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutoriallm/
